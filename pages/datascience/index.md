Data Science is an interdisciplinary field that uses various techniques and algorithms from Statistics, Mathematical Modelling, Pattern Recognition, Machine Learning and many more to gain insights in structured and unstructered data.

Of course we can only tackle very specific topics of this huge ecosystem within this workshop. We will briefly talk about the following topics:
- Dataframes
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Unsupervised Learning
- Supervised Learning
