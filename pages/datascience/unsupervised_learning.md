# Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning aims at learning patterns from unlabeled data. Typically the used algorithms fall into three main categories:
- Association rules to discover relationships between different variables (e.g. for recommender systems *customers who bought X also bought Y*)
- Clustering for grouping data based on their similarities (e.g. grouping news articles about similar topics)
- Dimensionality reduction for transforming data from a high-dimensional to a low-dimensional space (e.g. used for denoising images)

In this section we will quickly glimpse into clustering with an algorithm called *Kmeans* and into dimensionality reduction by applying the *Principal Component Analysis*.
