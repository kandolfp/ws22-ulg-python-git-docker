# Introduction to Python

This is not meant to be an full introduction to Python but rather a peek into some topics that are relevant for the goals of the curse in total. 
In order to better understand the material in the two subsections and for the exercises we recommend having a look at following online resources:

- [A Byte of Python](https://python.swaroopch.com/) for a basic introduction to Python. Especially the chapters beginning with _About Python_ up to _Problem Solving_.
- [Matplotlib tutorial](https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/introductory/pyplot.html) for an introduction to plotting-
- [Python for Beginners](https://www.pythonforbeginners.com/basics/list-comprehensions-in-python) has a very nice section about _list comprehensions_.

The actual sections can be found here:
