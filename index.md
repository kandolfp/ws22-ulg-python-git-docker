## Some general words on the organization of this workshop

For this workshop you do not need to be an Julia expert, not even a programming expert. We will introduce programming and Julia concepts along with examples. For this purpose you will find code blocks that you can copy if necessary (top right corner `copy`). Furthermore, if we think something is very important we will highlight it with a box:

@@important
Pay extra attention to the content here.

We also have various environments with different color coding that usually are collapsed to not hinder the reading process:
- Examples are green
\example{Examples are also quite nice because they make sure you have an idea what is happening.}
- Exercises are blue
\exercise{Exercises are here for you to work on, no worries not at home or in your off hours but with us in the workshop.

Some exercises will have *hidden* solutions which can be accessed by adding `?solution=true` to the URL of the page. 
This way it is more likely that everybody tries to do the exercises without first looking at the sample solution.}

That is about all we wanted to let you know, so let us get into it.
